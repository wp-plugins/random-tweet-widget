Shows a random tweet from a Twitter account in a sidebar widget.

== Description ==
This plugin displays a random post from a Twitter account in a sidebar widget. 

= Breaking news = 
This plugin is based on Twitter API version 1, that will be deleted on March 2013. 

The upcoming 2.0 plugin release, based on the new Twitter API version 1.1, requires you
to create a personal Twitter Application on the [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com/apps "dev.twitter.com") website.
Within your Application, Twitter provides two strings: the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret.
You also need two other strings, the Access Token and the Access Token Secret, that you can get
following [this guide](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom "this guide").
Finally, enter all the Authorization string in the widget options box, along with your favorite display settings: your Twitter Widget is now ready and active!

You can use the same Authorization strings for several widgets and multiple website. 
Just remember to store them in a safe place!

You also need to enable the CURL and OPENSSL extensions in your PHP environment.
